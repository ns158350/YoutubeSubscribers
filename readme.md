### **Subscribers Management System**

Welcome to the Subscribers Management System project! This is a simple Node.js application integrated with MongoDB, designed to manage subscriber records efficiently.

### Overview:
The Subscribers Management System provides a platform to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on subscriber data. It allows users to:

- Retrieve a list of all subscribers.
- Get a list of subscribers with only their names and subscribed channels.
- Fetch a specific subscriber by ID.

### Components:
The project consists of the following components:

- **App.js**: Handles request and response logic, defining routes for interacting with subscriber data.
- **Index.js**: Connects to the MongoDB database and starts the server.
- **CreateDatabase.js**: A script to set up the MongoDB database and populate it with sample subscriber data.
- **Models/subscribers.js**: Defines the schema for subscriber data in MongoDB.
- **Data.js**: Contains sample subscriber data to be inserted into the database.

### Setup Instructions:
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

- **Install MongoDB and Node.js on your system.**
